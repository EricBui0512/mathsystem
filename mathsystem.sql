State, with a reason, whether this gives a random sample of 10 children from the school.\n\n(b) A random sample of 50 children is taken from a large school. The number of children in this sample with access to a computer at home is 34. The overall proportion of children at the school with access to a computer at home is denoted by p. Test, at the 5% significance level, the null hypothesis p = 0.8 against the alternative hypothesis p <0.8, and find a symmetric 95% confidence interval for p.\n", "paper_id": "200402003", "topic_id": 67, "input": "IGNORE", "subtopic_id": 6702, "type": "IGNORE"}}, {"pk": "200402003013", "model": "DBManagement.question", "fields": {"question_no": 30, "std_answer": "IGNORE", "marks": 5, "type_answer": "IGNORE", "content": "Nov 2004 / Paper 2 / Q30\nAn unbiased red cubical die has two faces labeled 1, two faces labeled 2 and two faces labeled 3.

Random sampling\nIn a simple random sample (SRS) of a given size, all such subsets of the frame are given an equal probability. Each element of the frame thus has an equal probability of selection: the frame is not subdivided or partitioned. Furthermore, any given pair of elements has the same chance of selection as any other such pair (and similarly for triples, and so on). This minimises bias and simplifies analysis of results. In particular, the variance between individual results within the sample is a good indicator of variance in the overall population, which makes it relatively easy to estimate the accuracy of results.\n2 Systematic sampling\nSystematic sampling relies on arranging the study population according to some ordering scheme and then selecting elements at regular intervals through that ordered list. Systematic sampling involves a random start and then proceeds with the selection of every kth element from then onwards. In this case, k=(population size/sample size). It is important that the starting point is not automatically the first in the list, but is instead randomly chosen from within the first to the kth element in the list. A simple example would be to select every 10th name from the telephone directory (an 'every 10th' sample, also referred to as 'sampling with a skip of 10').\n3.Stratified sampling\nWhere the population embraces a number of distinct categories, the frame can be organized by these categories into separate \"strata.\" Each stratum is then sampled as an independent sub-population, out of which individual elements can be randomly selected.\n4. Quota sampling\nhe population is first segmented into mutually exclusive sub-groups, just as in stratified sampling. Then judgement is used to select the subjects or units from each segment based on a specified proportion. For example, an interviewer may be told to sample 200 females and 300 males between the age of 45 and 60.", "type": "C", "title": "Sampling_Distribution"}}, {"pk": 1979, "model": "DBManagement.tag_definitions", "fields": {"topic": 67, "content": "1.
